I interview creative folks who run online businesses for a video & podcast series called The Orbit. Using this research, I teamed up with illustrator Cheyenne Barton to write a small handbook for entrepreneurs called Sustainable Loops. Now, I serve as a knowledgeable resource for folks who want to get a grip on the future of work at Remotely Interesting.
